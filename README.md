# VSD RISC-V CHIP TAPEOUT


## Program Description
The **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** is a 20-week immersive initiative by VLSI System Design (VSD) that guides students, educators, and professionals through the full chip design flow—from RTL design to physical tape-out and post-silicon validation. Utilising the Synopsys EDA tool suite and the SCL180 nm PDK, this project combines online training, hands-on labs, and on-site execution at IIT Gandhinagar. Its goal is to create a reusable, documented flow that academic institutions across India can adopt to build production-grade SoCs.

## Contents
The program includes the following components:

1. **Training & Labs**
   - Online modules (first 10 weeks) covering RTL simulation, synthesis, gate-level simulation, and fundamental design constraints.  
   - Tools: iverilog, GTKWave, Yosys, OpenSTA, Xschem, ngspice, OpenLane.

2. **Project Initialization**
   - Top 50 participants engage on-site at IIT Gandhinagar.  
   - Tasks include housekeeping RTL, CPU/RISC-V ISA implementation, memory and macro integration, and full-chip gate-level simulation.

3. **Physical Design & Sign-off**
   - Floorplanning, placement, routing, clock tree synthesis (CTS), post-route timing, and multi-corner STA.  
   - IR/EM checks, layout verification (DRC/LVS), and final preparation for GDSII tape-out.

4. **Post-Silicon & Deliverables**
   - Tape-out submission package: GDSII files, documentation, timing reports, scripts.  
   - Embedded applications, testbenches, portfolios, post-silicon validation.

## Program Objectives
- Empower participants with end-to-end SoC design experience using industry-standard tools and PDKs.  
- Build a reference SoC tapeout flow that is reproducible, well-documented, and adoptable by academic institutions.  
- Foster collaboration between academia, students, and the semiconductor industry to bridge skill gaps.  
- Enable hands-on learning in both digital design and verification under near-real production constraints.

## Program Outcomes
Participants in the program will achieve:

- A fully documented RTL→GDSII flow, inclusive of synthesis, timing, physical implementation, and sign-off artifacts.  
- Corner-clean STA reports (e.g., TT/SS/FF), SDF-annotated gate-level simulation logs, and reproducible scripts for design automation.  
- Successful tape-out of a RISC-V SoC using SCL180 PDK along with its submission package.  
- Practical experience with both online training tools and on-site physical design workflows.  
- Enhanced portfolio: GitHub repository, testbenches, GDSII, and detailed project documentation.
